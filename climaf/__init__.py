"""
Climaf python modules are :
 - api       : the user interface, or Application Program Interface
 - classes   : define basic classes
 - dataloc   : handling data location and data access
 - operators : handling external scripts and binaries
 - driver    : gluing all that together, and interpreting commands

CliMAF user's are interested only by module ``api``, while CliMAF developpers may wish to
know more about the other modules, but ``driver``, which is rather for CliMAF wizzard's use
