Running CliMAF
-------------------------


.. _installing:

Installing (or not)
-------------------------

- If working on IPSL's Ciclad, at CNRM or on MF's Beaufix HPC machine, you do not need to install CliMAF; just 
  do as indicated below (as e.g. in section :ref:`running_inter`), replacing ``<some_installation_dir>`` by :

  - ``/cnrm/aster/data1/UTILS/climaf/current`` at CNRM

  - ``~senesi/climaf`` on Beaufix

  - ``~ssenesi/climaf`` on Ciclad


- Installing CliMAF, if necessary, is quick, through only a few commands, using CliMAF GitHub
  repository; this will also copy some data allowing for testing the installation and for running a few examples

  - first check the listed :ref:`requirements` ;

  - execute :: 

     cd some_installation_dir
     git clone https://github.com/senesis/climaf climaf
     cd climaf
     export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
     cd testing
     ./test_install.sh 
  
    and check the output of last command


.. _configuring:

Configuring CliMAF
---------------------

CliMAF do interpret some environment variables :

- CLIMAF_CACHE : a directory used for storing intermediate results,
  and those final results which are not explicitly copied elsewhere;
  defaults to ~/tmp/climaf_cache. 

- CLIMAF_LOG_LEVEL and CLIMAF_LOGFILE_LEVEL : for setting the
  verbosity level on stderr (resp. on file climaf.log); defaults to
  'error' (resp. 'info'). See :py:func:`~climaf.clogging.clog` for details

You may put in file ``~/.climaf`` any python code using CliMAF
functions; this will be executed at the end of climaf import; the code 
must use fully qualified names for Python functions (as in e.g. ``climaf.operators.cscript``): it des not
benefit from the intractive shortcuts defined in climaf.api (as
described below in :ref:`running_inter`


If running on Beaufix, you must setup your environment by::

  $ module load python/2.7.5 nco ncview ncl


.. _running_inter:

Running CliMAF interactively
-----------------------------

For running CliMAF as easily as possible under the Python prompt,
without having to know details about CliMAF functions location, and
just mimicking one of the :ref:`examples`, you can either :

- use binary ``climaf`` for launching Python while importing CliMAF :

  - set your PATH e.g. in your ``~/.profile`` file::

    $ export PATH=$PATH::<some_installation_dir>/climaf/bin

  - and then launch CliMAF ::

    $ climaf

    >>>         #(this is the Python prompt)


- or import ``climaf.api.*`` in your python environment :

  - set your PYTHONPATH , e.g. in your ``~/.profile`` file::

    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<some_installation_dir>/climaf

  - type ::

    $ python

    >>> from climaf.api import *
    >>> ...

   You may also use **CDAT** instead of Python. It is working at least
   for CDAT version using Python from 2.6.5.

Please see also : :ref:`examples`


Using CliMAF as a library
-----------------------------

If you wish to have the same facilities (shortcuts) than in interactive
sessions, and then insert ::

>>> from climaf.api import *

in each module making use of CliMAF functions. But you may prefer to
make only explicit imports, and then use::

>>> import climaf

In that latter case: 

- you must use fully qualified python names for climaf functions, such
  as ``climaf.classes.ds()``; you may have a look at module climaf.api
  to know in which module is each useful CliMAF function

- please note that all CliMAF operators declared using
  e.g. :py:func:`~climaf.operators.cscript` must be prefixed with
  "climaf.operators" as e.g. in ::

>>> avg=climaf.operators.time_average(ds)
