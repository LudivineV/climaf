Standard Operators
-------------------------------

CliMAF includes a number of 'Standard Operators', which implement more or less basic climate diagnostics or utilities. This set increases
with scientists contributions (see :ref:`how_to_contribute_a_script`). They are documented here, through
individual documentation files in `REStructured Text format <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_
and following :download:`this example <scripts_template.rst>` which renders :doc:`as shows here <scripts_template>`. 
For each operator, the content of the doc file is also made available in the Python on-line help (see :ref:`how_to_list_operators`).

Documented operators as of today : 

 - basic functions:
    - :doc:`scripts/llbox`
    - :doc:`scripts/regrid`
    - :doc:`scripts/regridn`
    - :doc:`scripts/time_average`
    - :doc:`scripts/space_average`
    - :doc:`scripts/minus`

     .. note:: Overview on the output format to be used for 'plot' and
	       'curves' operators w.r.t. figure trimming :
	       
	       - If you want a **PNG** figure, **you just have to call
		 'plot' or 'curves'**, and argument 'trim' allows to
		 remove extra white space. Note that resolution unit
		 is in pixels		   
		 
	       - If you want a **PDF** or **EPS** output figure, **you
		 may need a further step** to remove extra white
		 space: you have to use 'cpdfcrop' or 'cepscrop'
		 operator (which are slow) respectively, after the
		 figure plot. Note that resolution unit is in inches
		 or using a standard paper size by name
		 
     .. note:: Overview on method to create **a page with several
	       CliMAF figures**: 

	       - :py:func:`~climaf.classes.cpage`: this operator
		 creates a PNG or PDF page of figures array using
		 'ImageMagick', figures adjustment in the page is
		 adapted to figures size. If you use 'cpage', you
		 don't need any pre-processing because:
    
		 - 1/ argument 'fig_trim' allows to trim extra white
		   space of each figure;   
		 - 2/ argument 'page_trim' allows to trim extra white
		   space for the page   

	       - :py:func:`~climaf.classes.cpage_pdf`: this operator
		 creates a PDF page of figures array using 'pdfjam',
		 figures adjustment in each array cell is
		 automatically centered, you can't adjust figures
		 differently. So if you use 'cpage_pdf', you may need
		 to do pre and post-treatment because:
		 
		 - 1/ there is no argument 'fig_trim' allowing you to
		   trim extra white space when generating pdf figures, 
		   so you must apply 'cpdfcrop' before cpage_pdf (on all figures)
		 - 2/ there is no argument 'page_trim' allowing you to
		   trim extra white space when generating the page, so 
		   you must use 'cpdfcrop' on its output
    
		 **So, to create an array of figures:**
	       
	       - If you want an **PNG** output figure: you should use
		 **'cpage'**. If quality is not sufficient, increase
		 resolution of each figure (with argument 'resolution'
		 of 'curves' or 'plot' operator) and also page
		 resolution (with arguments 'page_width' and
		 'page_height' of 'cpage') 

	       - If you want an **PDF** output figure: you can use
		 either 'cpage_pdf' or 'cpage': 

		 - **'cpage_pdf'** is highly recommended 
		 - if you want to have more control on figures
		   adjustment in the page, use **'cpage'** and
		   increase resolution of each figure and also of 
		   output page

Albeit this is not a proper practice, **some more operators may exist in your CliMAF release** which would not be documented here. Please see :ref:`how_to_list_operators` for such cases
